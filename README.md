# Service Provider
A service seeker will be able to search service providers around his/her location. All service providers will receive a service request once service is requested, and if any service provider accepts the request, then service seeker will be notified that his/her service has been accepted, and a status message will be displayed with the name of the service provider. Technologies used to develop this application: React, Redux, google-maps-react, react-geolocated, google maps api, Socket.io, Express, Sequelize and PostgreSQL.
